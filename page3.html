                        <p>When I first arrived to grand central station I was mesmerised, the building is so nicely put together, I’ve always been an architecture fan, this was very interesting to me. The place was amazing, everything was going so fast, everyone was in a rush, every store was filed with people and the tourists were lost in this mayhem…

                        <p>My favourite piece of architecture in the city : the flat iron building, the structure, in the middle of broadway! It was extremely charming, I was fascinated!
