Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

On this website you will be able to explore my 2017 trip to America, in some very popular east cost cities and in my family's very quiet and soothing city. 
The "website" file contains the index.html page and every other page is numbered from 1 to 3, it also includes the stylesheets and images used for the creation of the website. The images are in the pictures file. The pictures in this project were all taken by me.


The navigation bar helps the user get around all 5 pages no matter which page he is on in the website through the hyperlinks.
The navigation bar includes an unordered <ul> list : for every destination presented. On each page there is one or multiple images illustrating the trip. The table displays the common facts of each cities.
The html files are linked to the same style sheets "stylesheet.css" and "style.scss".
There are different CSS properties such as "background-color" "margin" "padding" "font-size" "text-align" and more. 
There are also multiple #id and .class selectors in the divs.
For the reorganization of content based on the size of the viewport I used a .media query so that the content in each table would be smaller and I also used Flexbox, so that the pages would shrink accordingly depending on the size of the screen it is seen on.
I used Bootstrap 4 to create the navigation bar on my website and a grid model for the column in the first page.
In the style.scss file I modified the size and color of the  content with scss nesting. Unfortunately i was not able to purchase SASS so i didn't have a chance to test the scss file myself.
